# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game_in_C
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in C. The game is played between a user and the computer. The computer's choice is randomly generated, and the user selects their option from the available choices. Points are awarded to the user for each win.

How to Play
The program presents three options:

Stone (1)
Paper (2)
Scissor (3)

The user enters their choice by inputting the corresponding number (1, 2, or 3).

The computer randomly generates its choice.

The game logic determines the winner based on the rules:

Stone crushes Scissor.
Scissor cuts Paper.
Paper covers Stone.

The game announces whether the user wins, loses, or if it's a draw.

The user can choose to continue playing or exit the game.
